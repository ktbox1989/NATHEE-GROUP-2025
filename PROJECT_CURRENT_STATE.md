# NATHEE GROUP 2025 — Canonical Project State

Updated: 2026-08-21 (Asia/Bangkok)

## Source checkpoint

- Branch: `main`
- Latest verified implementation milestone: `7bd4bad` — Fail-closed Container Registry Foundation
- Canonical repository: `ktbox1989/NATHEE-GROUP-2025`
- Working rule: resolve the current checkpoint-document commit with `git rev-parse HEAD`; never infer Production deployment from source HEAD.

## Production evidence

- Public static website: LIVE at `https://natheegroup2025.com/`
- Z.com root: `/home/zptqqwps/public_html/natheegroup2025.com`
- Public routes: 11, with mandatory SEO/noindex/mobile gates
- Public Gallery: LIVE manifest v1, 10 categories, 0 published real images
- Canonical `/login/`: static noindex status page, not real Auth
- Canonical `/app`: 404
- Canonical `/api/health`: 404
- Protected Sites artifact: Version 4, source `9afd58d`, owner-only access
- Protected Sites environment variables: none configured
- Protected Sites D1: only the ten base tables from migration `0000`
- Full application Production acceptance: NOT PASSED

## Closed local milestones

### Public website and deployment safety

- Multi-page public site, canonical domain guard, SEO, Gallery manifest, Z.com backup/deploy/postcheck/rollback and production-scope disclosure are implemented.
- `DEPLOY_PASS` applies only to the public static component.

### Role and Permission Foundation (`7b618cc`)

- Canonical roles: OWNER, ADMIN, STAFF, SALE, WAREHOUSE, CHECKER, DRIVER, ACCOUNTING, CUSTOMER_ADMIN, CUSTOMER_VIEWER.
- OWNER has business capabilities; every other internal role is fail-closed and requires explicit permissions.
- Customer roles require a company and can read only records belonging to that company.
- Legacy CUSTOMER maps to least-privilege CUSTOMER_VIEWER; legacy OWNER/STAFF remain usable even before role backfill.
- Migration `0004_role_system_foundation` is additive: role-assignment table, legacy backfill, indexes and compatibility triggers.
- No Production migration was applied.

### Audited Member Lifecycle (`cdfc445`)

- OWNER can change another member's canonical role, customer company, explicit permissions and ACTIVE/INACTIVE state without hard deletion.
- The current OWNER cannot demote or deactivate their own identity; database triggers independently preserve at least one active OWNER.
- D1 mutations use a revision/request claim, atomic batch, stale-write rejection and an Audit Log reason.
- Member rendering is bounded to 50 records per keyset page; permissions are queried only for visible users.
- Migration `0005_member_lifecycle_safety` is additive and remains unapplied in Production.

### Recipient-scoped In-app Notifications (`bc10879`)

- Motorcycle status events atomically create real notifications for active same-company customers, other OWNER identities and internal users explicitly granted `status:read`.
- The event actor, inactive users, unauthorized staff and customers from other companies are excluded.
- Recipient queries and read mutations always require the authenticated `recipient_user_id`; notification links are normalized local `/app/` paths.
- Unique event/recipient idempotency keys prevent duplicate notifications; unread lookup and inbox rendering are indexed and bounded to 50 records per keyset page.
- Private application metadata is `noindex`; LINE/Email delivery is intentionally not enabled without provider credentials and policy.
- Migration `0006_in_app_notifications` is additive and remains unapplied in Production.

### Truck and Trip Foundation (`5b392dc`)

- Added real truck records for verified 4-wheel/6-wheel/other classification, optional confirmed capacity, registration uniqueness and non-destructive status.
- Added trip records with transaction-safe TRIP numbering, optional active DRIVER assignment, Bangkok-to-UTC planning times and a guarded DRAFT→PLANNED→LOADING→IN_TRANSIT→ARRIVED→COMPLETED lifecycle.
- Create operations use unique request keys to prevent double-submit duplication; status updates use optimistic state, append-only trip events and Audit Log in one D1 batch.
- Database triggers independently reject inactive trucks and users without the active DRIVER role.
- Internal UI is customer-blocked, responsive and bounded to 50 trips per keyset page; the fleet selector/list is capped at 200 pending a dedicated fleet search contract.
- Migration `0007_truck_trip_foundation` is additive and remains unapplied in Production.

### Audited Trip–Motorcycle Load Board (`8dd8e8a`)

- Added an additive trip/motorcycle assignment ledger with request-key idempotency, one active trip per motorcycle, company matching, truck-capacity enforcement and a hard ceiling of 1,000 assignments when confirmed capacity is absent.
- Assignment state is coordinated with the existing audited motorcycle workflow: a trip never changes motorcycle status implicitly, so existing status events, notifications and audit evidence remain authoritative.
- Database triggers independently require DRAFT/PLANNED + SCHEDULED for assignment, LOADING + LOADED for load confirmation, ARRIVED + ARRIVED/DELIVERED/CLOSED for unload confirmation, and complete delivery readiness before trip completion.
- Cancellation/completion preserves assignment history by releasing records in the same D1 batch as trip event and Audit writes; assignment hard delete is rejected.
- Added a responsive real-data Load Board with readiness explanations, bounded 50-record keyset pages, 100-item eligible selector and no fake load counts.
- Motorcycle detail now exposes its active trip/assignment context to authorized internal users, while customer views remain isolated from internal trip operations.
- Fleet and eligible-motorcycle search uses validated prefix terms, separate field-specific index queries and bounded server-side merging; query-plan tests reject the former OR-scan behavior.
- Trip lists can be filtered by indexed lifecycle status without losing keyset bounds.
- Migration `0008_trip_motorcycle_loads` upgrades an existing `0007` database without rewriting prior trips and remains unapplied in Production.

### Fail-closed Container Registry Foundation (`7bd4bad`)

- Added shipping-container records with ISO 6346 owner/category format and check-digit validation, unique opaque public identity, Seal, 20FT/40FT/40HC type, optional confirmed motorcycle capacity, port and destination country.
- Create is request-key idempotent and commits the DRAFT record, initial status event and redacted Audit entry in one D1 batch.
- Container identity/history cannot be hard-deleted or rewritten. Lifecycle advancement is deliberately blocked at the database until the next vehicle-assignment migration can enforce load, capacity, Seal and motorcycle-state readiness.
- Added internal-only, responsive `/app/containers` registry with a 50-record keyset page and explicit warning that it is not yet a Container Load Manifest.
- Migration `0009_container_registry` is additive and remains unapplied in Production.

## Verified source gates

- Full test suite: 71 passing
- Authorization/unit tests: 44 passing
- Render/schema/notification/yard/trip/container/query-plan tests: 27 passing
- Production Vinext build: PASS
- ESLint: PASS
- Public SEO and deployment architecture guards: PASS
- Migrations through `0009` packaged in `dist/.openai/drizzle/`: PASS

## Open Owner gates

- Approve application routing model: apex edge routes or an application subdomain.
- Supply/configure Supabase Production values through a secure hosting channel.
- Backup and apply migrations `0001`–`0009` to the protected D1 runtime.
- Verify private R2 readiness.
- Bootstrap the real OWNER identity and accept two-company customer isolation.
- Add real company Gallery photographs and verified location/map data.

## Next autonomous work

1. Add container/motorcycle assignments, capacity/Seal readiness and audited lifecycle before enabling any non-DRAFT container state.
2. Continue dependency order: Inspection/Damage, POD, documents and print center.
3. Add bounded Company Search before management selector limits are reached.
4. Replace the still-bounded 200-driver selector with an indexed driver lookup before large staff rollout.
5. Keep all new migrations local until Production backup/runtime gates are satisfied.

## Prohibited claims

- Do not report the full application as Production-deployed.
- Do not report Auth, D1, R2, QR, Gallery Manager or notifications as Production-ready without live acceptance evidence.
- Do not apply Production migrations, DNS, credentials or deployment changes without the corresponding Owner gate.
